# Architecture

Parley ships as two programs: `parleyd`, the hub (server), and `parley`, the
command-line client. Both are written in Go, in the module
`github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley`, and the server uses the standard library's
`net/http` with no web framework.

## Package layout

| Package | Holds |
|---|---|
| `cmd/parley` | the `parley` program: it calls `cli.Run` and exits with its status |
| `cmd/parleyd` | the `parleyd` program: argument parsing, signals, the start log line and the exit status |
| `internal/buildinfo` | the version, commit and build time the binary was built with, shared by both programs |
| `internal/cli` | the `parley` client: its root command and its subcommands, built with `github.com/spf13/cobra` |
| `internal/server` | the hub's HTTP server: its built-in routes, the REST API's route registration and check pipeline, the error envelope, request ids, response headers and the access log, list paging, idempotency keys, and the readiness probes |
| `internal/server/timefmt` | the one timestamp format (`Format`, and the response member type `Time`) and the one duration grammar (`ParseDuration`); a leaf package that imports nothing of the project, so that the configuration loader can use it as well as the REST API |
| `test/e2e` | tests that build the binaries and run them |

## The HTTP server

`server.New(server.Options)` builds the server, and `(*Server).Handler()`
returns the `http.Handler` that serves its routes. `Options` holds the listen
address (`Addr`), the shutdown grace (`ShutdownGrace`), the readiness
probes (`ReadinessProbes`) and `OnListen`, a function `Serve` calls once with
the address it bound (with port `0` in `Addr`, the port the system chose),
the REST body limit (`MaxBodySize`), the rate limit (`RequestsPerMinute`,
`RateLimitDisabled`, and `Now`, the clock it and the idempotency records
read, which tests replace), the `Logger` (a `*slog.Logger`; nil means
`slog.Default()`), `LogHealthProbes` and the `IdempotencyStore` (nil means
an in-memory store).
`Serve` serves `Handler()`, so the running hub and in-process tests answer
the same way.

Every route is registered on one standard library `http.ServeMux` with
method and path patterns: the built-in `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` and
`GET /version`, the REST API routes, and surfaces outside the REST API that
later packages mount with `(*Server).Handle(pattern, handler)`, which takes
the mux's own patterns and bypasses the REST API's checks. Success bodies are
written with `server.WriteJSON`, errors with `server.WriteError`, both with
`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`. The routes are described in
[api.md](api.md).

### Request ids, headers and the access log

`Handler()` returns the dispatcher below wrapped in one outermost middleware
(`internal/server/headers.go`), so it covers every surface: the built-in
routes, the REST API, unknown paths and surfaces mounted with `Handle`. Before
anything else runs it:

1. takes the request id from an incoming `X-Request-ID` that is a UUID in the
   36-character hyphenated hexadecimal form (any version, either case),
   unchanged, or else generates a random version 4 UUID from `crypto/rand`;
   puts it in the request's context, where `server.RequestID(ctx)` reads it;
2. sets `X-Request-ID`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on the response;
3. sets `Cache-Control: no-store` when the path is `/api/v1` or under it. The
   pipeline replaces it with the matched route's `CacheControl` when the route
   states one; the `/healthz` and `/readyz` handlers set `no-cache` and the
   `/version` handler `public, max-age=300`.

It hands the request on with a `ResponseWriter` that records the status. The
wrapper keeps `Unwrap()`, so `http.ResponseController` (flush, deadlines)
still reaches the connection's writer. When the request is answered, it writes
the access-log line (`internal/server/accesslog.go`) through `Options.Logger`:
message `request` with `method`, `path` (`r.URL.Path`, never the query
string, so a credential sent as a query parameter never reaches the log),
`status`, `duration_ms` and `request_id`, at info level. Requests to
`/healthz` and `/readyz` get a line only when `Options.LogHealthProbes` is
set, and then at debug level.

### Dispatch

The dispatcher sits in front of the mux. The mux alone would
redirect a path that is not clean (`//x`, `/a/../x`) or that lacks the
trailing slash of a subtree pattern, and would answer an unknown path or a
wrong method in plain text. The dispatcher answers a path that is not clean
with the `404 not_found` envelope, asks the mux (`ServeMux.Handler`) which
pattern matches, and answers no match with the `404 not_found` envelope, or
with `405 method_not_allowed` and the mux's `Allow` list when the path is
registered under other methods. It removes the `HEAD` that the mux adds for
every `GET` pattern unless a `HEAD` pattern exists for the path. A redirect
the mux would send for a missing trailing slash is a `404` too. Everything
else goes to `ServeMux.ServeHTTP`.

### REST routes

A feature registers a REST route with `(*Server).Register(server.Route)`.
`Route.Method` is an upper-case method, `Route.Pattern` a path relative to
`/api/v1` with `:name` parameters (`/workspaces/:slug/tokens`), and
`Route.Handler` a `server.HandlerFunc`,
`func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) error`: it writes its own response
on success, and an error it returns is written as the envelope. The route's
declarations are `Public`, `Create` with its `ShowOnce` members, its own
`MaxBodySize`, `ContentType` and `CacheControl`, its `Feature` check, the one
`Scope` a personal access token needs (a name the server does not interpret)
and `Marks`, named values whose meaning the installed checks define.
`Register` turns the pattern into the mux's form
(`POST /api/v1/workspaces/{slug}/tokens`) and panics on a pattern that does
not start with a slash, ends in one, has an empty, `.` or `..` segment, a
brace, or a parameter without a valid name or named twice, on a method that
is not upper-case letters, on a missing handler and on a route already
registered.

Each check and the handler read the route their request matched with
`server.MatchedRoute(r)`: a `server.Matched` with the method and pattern as
registered, the `Route` and the path parameter values (`Params`);
`server.Param(r, name)` returns one value.

### The check pipeline

After the mux has matched a REST route, the pipeline runs the route's checks
in a fixed order and stops at the first error:

1. authentication, through the installed `server.Authenticator`,
   `func(*http.Request) (server.Caller, error)`; with none installed, a route
   that is not public is answered `401 unauthenticated`;
2. the rate-limit stage (`internal/server/ratelimit.go`): it counts the
   request against the caller's credential id, or against the connection's
   remote IP address on a public route, and answers `429 rate_limited` with
   `Retry-After` when the key is over the limit;
3. the body stage (`internal/server/body.go`): it reads the whole body, up to
   one byte past the limit that applies (the route's `MaxBodySize`, else
   `Options.MaxBodySize`, else 1048576 bytes), answers `413
   payload_too_large` when the declared length or the bytes read exceed it,
   then, for a non-empty `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` body, answers `415
   unsupported_media_type` unless the `Content-Type` media type is the
   route's `ContentType` or, when it states none, `application/json`. The
   buffered bytes replace the request's body and stay in its context, so a
   later stage can read them without consuming the body the handler reads;
4. the route's `Feature` check, the binding guard (`SetBindingGuard`), the
   scope check (`SetScopeCheck`) and the access checks (`AddAccessCheck`), in
   that order; each is a `server.Check`, `func(*http.Request) error`, and an
   empty position passes;
5. on a route declared `Create`, the idempotency stage
   (`internal/server/idempotency.go`), described below;
6. the handler.

A public route skips authentication and step 4. The access position holds a
list: every check added with `AddAccessCheck` runs, in the order it was
added, and decides from the matched route whether it applies. The
authenticator reports a `server.Caller` (`CredentialID`, and `UserID` or
`Admin` for the admin token), which the pipeline puts in the request's
context; later checks and the handler read it with
`server.CallerOf(r.Context())`. An `*server.Error` (also when wrapped) is
written as its envelope; any other error as `500 internal` with the message
`internal error`, and its text is logged through `Options.Logger` as an
error line `internal error` with the `request_id` and the `error`. When the
handler had already started its answer, nothing is written after it: the
error is logged as `error after the answer began` with the `request_id` and
the `error`. The
pipeline also recovers a panic in a check or the handler: it logs an error
line `panic` with the `request_id`, the panic value as `error` and the
`stack`, and answers `500 internal` unless the handler had already started
its answer. A panic with `http.ErrAbortHandler` is passed on, so net/http
drops the connection as the handler asked. A panic on a surface outside the
REST API is not recovered: net/http drops that connection, and the access
log records the request with status `500`.

A request that authentication refuses, also for want of an authenticator,
is counted against its remote IP address and then answered with
authentication's error: authentication comes before the rate limit in the
order of checks, so the address's count decides the answer only on public
routes.

The rate limit is a `server.Limiter`: `NewLimiter(perMinute, now)` counts
requests per string key in fixed windows of 60 seconds, each starting at the
key's first counted request, and `(*Limiter).Allow(key)` reports whether a
request is admitted and, when not, the whole seconds to the window's end
(rounded up, at least 1). A refused request does not change the window, and
a limit of 0 admits everything. It is safe for concurrent use, keeps its
counts in memory only, and drops ended windows at most once a minute. The
server builds one from `RequestsPerMinute` (0 means 600) unless
`RateLimitDisabled` is set, and `(*Server).RateLimiter()` returns it so that a
surface mounted with `Handle`, such as the git server, counts against the same
keys. Its keys are `credential:<id>` (a caller with a credential id) and
`address:<ip>` (no caller, or a caller without a credential id). Built-in routes and
`Handle` surfaces do not pass the pipeline, and `404`/`405` are answered by
the dispatcher before it, so none of them is counted.

A handler decodes a JSON body with `server.DecodeJSON(r, &v)`, which
returns `400 invalid_request` for an empty body, invalid JSON, a value that
is not an object or data after the object, and ignores unknown members.

A list handler pages through `internal/server/list.go`:

1. `server.ReadPage(r, bounds...)` reads `limit` and `cursor` from the query
   and returns a `server.Page`, or a `400 invalid_request` error that the
   handler returns before it reads its collection. The limit defaults to 50
   within 1–200; a route with other bounds passes its own
   `server.PageBounds{Default, Min, Max}` as the argument (there is no `Route`
   field for it).
2. `(server.Page).After(&pos)` decodes the position the page continues after
   into a value of the handler's own type, the keyset of its total order, and
   reports false on the first page.
3. The handler fetches up to `page.Limit+1` items after that position and
   calls `server.WritePage(w, page, items, position)`, which writes the first
   `Limit` items as `items` (`[]` for none) and, when the extra item exists,
   `next_cursor` from `position` of the last item written, else `null`.

A cursor is the unpadded URL-safe base64 form of the JSON document
`{"p": <position>, "f": <fingerprint>}`. The fingerprint is a truncated
SHA-256 of the matched route's method and pattern as registered, its path
parameter values and every query parameter except `cursor` and `limit`, so a
cursor is refused on another query but accepted with another limit. Cursors
are not signed: a cursor grants nothing, since every page passes the full
order of checks again.

The idempotency stage runs on create routes only, after every check, so a
replay is authenticated and authorised like the request it repeats. A
request without an `Idempotency-Key` header, every request to a public
route, which has no caller to record for, and a request whose caller has no
admin flag, user id or credential id, goes straight to the handler. A key that is empty or longer
than 255 characters (counted in characters, not bytes) is `400
invalid_request`. Otherwise the record is identified by three strings: the
key, the caller (`admin-token` when `Caller.Admin`, else `user:<UserID>`,
else `credential:<CredentialID>`) and
the route (the method, one space and the concrete `r.URL.Path`, such as
`POST /api/v1/workspaces/w1/tokens`). The stage then:

1. takes the per-record gate for that identity (below);
2. finds the record; one whose `WrittenAt` is 24 hours or more before
   `Options.Now()` is treated as absent. A valid record with the SHA-256 of
   the buffered request body is replayed as `200` with its body and
   `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`; one with another hash is
   `409 conflict`, and the record is left as it is;
3. otherwise runs the handler through a writer that passes the response
   through unchanged and keeps a copy of its status and body (it has
   `Unwrap()`, so the status-capturing writer of the headers middleware below
   it and `http.ResponseController` keep working);
4. when the handler returned no error and answered `2xx`, removes the route's
   `ShowOnce` members from a copy of the body (a member name, or a dotted path
   into nested objects such as `token.token`; a path the body lacks is
   skipped; an object it changes is re-encoded with its members in sorted
   order and without white space between them, and every value kept is
   unchanged), calls
   `DeleteExpired` with the cutoff `now - 24h` and then `Write`s the record.
   A body that is not a JSON object while `ShowOnce` names members, or a store
   error, is logged as `idempotency record not written` with the
   `request_id` and the `error`, and nothing is recorded: the caller already
   has the handler's answer;
5. records nothing for any other status or for an error.

The records live behind `server.IdempotencyStore`, which package 03
implements over its transactional store and installs as
`Options.IdempotencyStore`:

```go
type IdempotencyStore interface {
	Find(ctx context.Context, key, caller, route string) (IdempotencyRecord, bool, error)
	Write(ctx context.Context, rec IdempotencyRecord) error
	DeleteExpired(ctx context.Context, cutoff time.Time) error
}

type IdempotencyRecord struct {
	Key         string            // the Idempotency-Key, 1–255 characters
	Caller      string            // "admin-token", "user:<id>" or "credential:<id>"
	Route       string            // "POST /api/v1/..." with the concrete path
	RequestHash [sha256.Size]byte // SHA-256 of the request body's bytes
	Body        []byte            // the response body without its show-once members
	WrittenAt   time.Time         // the server's clock when written
}
```

- `Find` returns the record whose `Key`, `Caller` and `Route` are all equal
  to its arguments, and `false` when there is none. It may return an
  expired record that is not deleted yet; the server decides from
  `WrittenAt` and never replays it.
- `Write` stores the record, replacing any record with the same `Key`,
  `Caller` and `Route` (a key whose record expired is recorded anew).
- `DeleteExpired` removes every record whose `WrittenAt` is at or before
  `cutoff`, that is, every record 24 hours old or older.
- An error from `Find` ends the request as `500 internal`; an error from
  `DeleteExpired` or `Write` is logged, as above. Every method must be safe
  for concurrent use. The stage calls only these three methods and keeps no
  record of its own.

`server.NewMemoryIdempotencyStore()` is the in-memory implementation and the
server's default; its records are lost when the process ends.

The gate that orders requests with one identity is in memory in either case,
since the hub is one process: a map from (key, caller, route) to a slot with
a one-token channel and a count of the requests holding or awaiting it. A
request takes the token before it reads the store and gives it back after the
record is written or the request has failed, so a request waiting on the same
identity sees the record when the first one succeeded, and exactly one waiter
runs the handler when it failed. The map's mutex is held only to find or drop
a slot, never while a request waits or runs, so requests with different keys,
callers or paths never wait for each other; a slot is dropped when its count
reaches zero. A waiting request whose client goes away stops waiting.

The installed checks are copied under a read lock at the start of each
request, and no lock is held while a check or a handler runs, so a request
blocked in its handler never holds up another one.

### Timestamps and durations

Timestamps and durations are written and read in `internal/server/timefmt`,
not in `internal/server` itself, because the package imports nothing of the
project: the configuration loader can parse its duration keys with it
without importing the HTTP server. `timefmt.Format(t)` writes an instant as
RFC 3339 in UTC with the fraction of a second truncated. A response struct
declares a timestamp member as `timefmt.Time` (a defined type over
`time.Time`, converted with `timefmt.Time(t)`), whose `MarshalJSON` writes
the same string, so no handler formats a timestamp by hand.
`timefmt.ParseDuration(s)` reads a whole number with one of the units `s`,
`m`, `h` or `d`; it checks the digits itself, because `strconv` would accept
a sign, and refuses a value whose product with the unit would overflow a
`time.Duration`. No route or configuration key uses the package yet.

### Serving and stopping

`(*Server).Serve(ctx)` binds `Addr` with `net.Listen("tcp", …)`, returns the
error (`listen on <addr>: …`) when it cannot, calls `OnListen`, and serves
until `ctx` is cancelled. Then it stops in this order:

1. It closes the listener, so new connections are refused.
2. It waits up to 100 ms for connections that are accepted but whose request
   has not been read yet. `http.Server.Shutdown` would drop those, and a
   request the client had already sent would get no answer.
3. It calls `http.Server.Shutdown` with a deadline of `ShutdownGrace`, which
   waits for in-flight requests to finish and closes idle connections.
4. When the grace passes first, it calls `http.Server.Close`, which closes the
   remaining connections; their clients get no response. `Serve` does not
   wait for those handlers to return.

`Serve` returns `nil` after a stop, whether or not the grace passed.

## parleyd

`cmd/parleyd` holds `main` and a `run` function that does the work:
`run(ctx, args, addr, grace, stdout, stderr)` returns the exit status, and
`main` calls it with the defaults `0.0.0.0:8080` and 15 seconds and passes the
result to `os.Exit`. Tests call `run` with `127.0.0.1:0` and a grace of
milliseconds. `run`:

1. parses the arguments with the standard `flag` package (`--help` prints the
   usage on stdout and returns `0`; an unknown flag or any positional
   argument prints an error and the usage on stderr and returns `2`);
2. derives the serving context with `signal.NotifyContext` for `SIGTERM` and
   `SIGINT`, before the listener is bound;
3. builds the server and calls `Serve`, with an `OnListen` that writes the
   start line, a JSON object with `"msg":"listening"` and the bound
   `"addr"`, to stderr with `log/slog`'s JSON handler, and the same logger as
   `Options.Logger`, so the access log and internal errors go to stderr too;
4. returns `1` after one `cannot listen` error line when the address cannot
   be bound, and `0` when `Serve` returns after a stop.

The flags, exit statuses and log lines are described in [cli.md](cli.md),
the fixed address and grace in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

### Readiness probes

A readiness probe is a `server.Probe`, a `func(context.Context) error` that
returns an error when one part of the hub is not ready. `GET /readyz` calls
every probe with the request's context, including those after one has failed,
and answers `503` with `{"status":"not ready"}` if any failed. With no probe
registered the hub is ready. A probe's error text never goes into the
response.

## parley

`cmd/parley` calls `cli.Run(ctx, os.Args[1:], os.Stdout, os.Stderr)` and passes
its result to `os.Exit`. `Run` builds a fresh cobra command tree on each call:
the root command `parley` with the persistent flag `--endpoint-url`, and the
`version` subcommand. It executes the tree with the arguments, and returns `0`,
or `2` after one `error: <message>` line on stderr when cobra cannot parse the
arguments. Cobra's own error and usage output is silenced.

`parley version` reads its build from `internal/buildinfo` and asks the hub
for its build with a plain `net/http` client over HTTP (`GET /version`, 5 s
timeout). `internal/cli` imports `internal/buildinfo` and nothing from
`internal/server`, so the client carries no server code. The commands, output
and exit statuses are described in [cli.md](cli.md).

## Build information

`internal/buildinfo` has three package-level string variables, `Version`,
`Commit` and `BuildTime`, that are set when the binary is linked, with one `-X` linker flag each:

```sh
go build -ldflags "\
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.Version=1.4.0 \
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.Commit=3f2a1bc \
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.BuildTime=2026-01-02T03:04:05Z" \
  ./cmd/parleyd
```

The same flags build `./cmd/parley`. `test/e2e` builds both programs this way
and checks that `parley version` reports the values.

`buildinfo.Get()` returns them as a `buildinfo.Info`, with the Go toolchain's
version (`runtime.Version()`) as `GoVersion`. A value that was not set is
reported as `dev` (version) or `unknown` (commit and build time); a value that
was set is reported unchanged. `GET /version` calls `Get()` on every request.

The package lives under `internal/` and outside `internal/server` so that the
client can report its own build without importing server code.
