# Architecture

Parley ships as two programs: `parleyd`, the hub (server), and `parley`, the
command-line client. Both are written in Go, in the module
`github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley`, and the server uses the standard library's
`net/http` with no web framework.

## Package layout

| Package | Holds |
|---|---|
| `cmd/parley` | the `parley` program: it calls `cli.Run` and exits with its status |
| `cmd/parleyd` | the `parleyd` program: argument parsing, signals, the start log line and the exit status |
| `internal/buildinfo` | the version, commit and build time the binary was built with, shared by both programs |
| `internal/cli` | the `parley` client: its root command and its subcommands, built with `github.com/spf13/cobra` |
| `internal/server` | the hub's HTTP server: its built-in routes, the REST API's route registration and check pipeline, the error envelope, and the readiness probes |
| `test/e2e` | tests that build the binaries and run them |

## The HTTP server

`server.New(server.Options)` builds the server, and `(*Server).Handler()`
returns the `http.Handler` that serves its routes. `Options` holds the listen
address (`Addr`), the shutdown grace (`ShutdownGrace`), the readiness
probes (`ReadinessProbes`) and `OnListen`, a function `Serve` calls once with
the address it bound (with port `0` in `Addr`, the port the system chose),
the REST body limit (`MaxBodySize`) and the rate limit (`RequestsPerMinute`,
`RateLimitDisabled`, and `Now`, the clock it reads, which tests replace).
`Serve` serves `Handler()`, so the running hub and in-process tests answer
the same way.

Every route is registered on one standard library `http.ServeMux` with
method and path patterns: the built-in `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` and
`GET /version`, the REST API routes, and surfaces outside the REST API that
later packages mount with `(*Server).Handle(pattern, handler)`, which takes
the mux's own patterns and bypasses the REST API's checks. Success bodies are
written with `server.WriteJSON`, errors with `server.WriteError`, both with
`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`. The routes are described in
[api.md](api.md).

### Dispatch

`Handler()` returns a dispatcher in front of the mux. The mux alone would
redirect a path that is not clean (`//x`, `/a/../x`) or that lacks the
trailing slash of a subtree pattern, and would answer an unknown path or a
wrong method in plain text. The dispatcher answers a path that is not clean
with the `404 not_found` envelope, asks the mux (`ServeMux.Handler`) which
pattern matches, and answers no match with the `404 not_found` envelope, or
with `405 method_not_allowed` and the mux's `Allow` list when the path is
registered under other methods. It removes the `HEAD` that the mux adds for
every `GET` pattern unless a `HEAD` pattern exists for the path. A redirect
the mux would send for a missing trailing slash is a `404` too. Everything
else goes to `ServeMux.ServeHTTP`.

### REST routes

A feature registers a REST route with `(*Server).Register(server.Route)`.
`Route.Method` is an upper-case method, `Route.Pattern` a path relative to
`/api/v1` with `:name` parameters (`/workspaces/:slug/tokens`), and
`Route.Handler` a `server.HandlerFunc`,
`func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) error`: it writes its own response
on success, and an error it returns is written as the envelope. The route's
declarations are `Public`, `Create` with its `ShowOnce` members, its own
`MaxBodySize`, `ContentType` and `CacheControl`, its `Feature` check, the one
`Scope` a personal access token needs (a name the server does not interpret)
and `Marks`, named values whose meaning the installed checks define.
`Register` turns the pattern into the mux's form
(`POST /api/v1/workspaces/{slug}/tokens`) and panics on a pattern that does
not start with a slash, ends in one, has an empty, `.` or `..` segment, a
brace, or a parameter without a valid name or named twice, on a method that
is not upper-case letters, on a missing handler and on a route already
registered.

Each check and the handler read the route their request matched with
`server.MatchedRoute(r)`: a `server.Matched` with the method and pattern as
registered, the `Route` and the path parameter values (`Params`);
`server.Param(r, name)` returns one value.

### The check pipeline

After the mux has matched a REST route, the pipeline runs the route's checks
in a fixed order and stops at the first error:

1. authentication, through the installed `server.Authenticator`,
   `func(*http.Request) (server.Caller, error)`; with none installed, a route
   that is not public is answered `401 unauthenticated`;
2. the rate-limit stage (`internal/server/ratelimit.go`): it counts the
   request against the caller's credential id, or against the connection's
   remote IP address on a public route, and answers `429 rate_limited` with
   `Retry-After` when the key is over the limit;
3. the body stage (`internal/server/body.go`): it reads the whole body, up to
   one byte past the limit that applies (the route's `MaxBodySize`, else
   `Options.MaxBodySize`, else 1048576 bytes), answers `413
   payload_too_large` when the declared length or the bytes read exceed it,
   then, for a non-empty `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` body, answers `415
   unsupported_media_type` unless the `Content-Type` media type is the
   route's `ContentType` or, when it states none, `application/json`. The
   buffered bytes replace the request's body and stay in its context, so a
   later stage can read them without consuming the body the handler reads;
4. the route's `Feature` check, the binding guard (`SetBindingGuard`), the
   scope check (`SetScopeCheck`) and the access checks (`AddAccessCheck`), in
   that order; each is a `server.Check`, `func(*http.Request) error`, and an
   empty position passes;
5. the handler.

A public route skips authentication and step 4. The access position holds a
list: every check added with `AddAccessCheck` runs, in the order it was
added, and decides from the matched route whether it applies. The
authenticator reports a `server.Caller` (`CredentialID`, and `UserID` or
`Admin` for the admin token), which the pipeline puts in the request's
context; later checks and the handler read it with
`server.CallerOf(r.Context())`. An `*server.Error` (also when wrapped) is
written as its envelope; any other error as `500 internal` with the message
`internal error`.

A request that authentication refuses, also for want of an authenticator,
is counted against its remote IP address and then answered with
authentication's error: authentication comes before the rate limit in the
order of checks, so the address's count decides the answer only on public
routes.

The rate limit is a `server.Limiter`: `NewLimiter(perMinute, now)` counts
requests per string key in fixed windows of 60 seconds, each starting at the
key's first counted request, and `(*Limiter).Allow(key)` reports whether a
request is admitted and, when not, the whole seconds to the window's end
(rounded up, at least 1). A refused request does not change the window, and
a limit of 0 admits everything. It is safe for concurrent use, keeps its
counts in memory only, and drops ended windows at most once a minute. The
server builds one from `RequestsPerMinute` (0 means 600) unless
`RateLimitDisabled` is set, and `(*Server).RateLimiter()` returns it so that a
surface mounted with `Handle`, such as the git server, counts against the same
keys. Its keys are `credential:<id>` and `address:<ip>`. Built-in routes and
`Handle` surfaces do not pass the pipeline, and `404`/`405` are answered by
the dispatcher before it, so none of them is counted.

A handler decodes a JSON body with `server.DecodeJSON(r, &v)`, which
returns `400 invalid_request` for an empty body, invalid JSON, a value that
is not an object or data after the object, and ignores unknown members.

The installed checks are copied under a read lock at the start of each
request, and no lock is held while a check or a handler runs, so a request
blocked in its handler never holds up another one.

### Serving and stopping

`(*Server).Serve(ctx)` binds `Addr` with `net.Listen("tcp", …)`, returns the
error (`listen on <addr>: …`) when it cannot, calls `OnListen`, and serves
until `ctx` is cancelled. Then it stops in this order:

1. It closes the listener, so new connections are refused.
2. It waits up to 100 ms for connections that are accepted but whose request
   has not been read yet. `http.Server.Shutdown` would drop those, and a
   request the client had already sent would get no answer.
3. It calls `http.Server.Shutdown` with a deadline of `ShutdownGrace`, which
   waits for in-flight requests to finish and closes idle connections.
4. When the grace passes first, it calls `http.Server.Close`, which closes the
   remaining connections; their clients get no response. `Serve` does not
   wait for those handlers to return.

`Serve` returns `nil` after a stop, whether or not the grace passed.

## parleyd

`cmd/parleyd` holds `main` and a `run` function that does the work:
`run(ctx, args, addr, grace, stdout, stderr)` returns the exit status, and
`main` calls it with the defaults `0.0.0.0:8080` and 15 seconds and passes the
result to `os.Exit`. Tests call `run` with `127.0.0.1:0` and a grace of
milliseconds. `run`:

1. parses the arguments with the standard `flag` package (`--help` prints the
   usage on stdout and returns `0`; an unknown flag or any positional
   argument prints an error and the usage on stderr and returns `2`);
2. derives the serving context with `signal.NotifyContext` for `SIGTERM` and
   `SIGINT`, before the listener is bound;
3. builds the server and calls `Serve`, with an `OnListen` that writes the
   start line, a JSON object with `"msg":"listening"` and the bound
   `"addr"`, to stderr with `log/slog`'s JSON handler;
4. returns `1` after one `cannot listen` error line when the address cannot
   be bound, and `0` when `Serve` returns after a stop.

The flags, exit statuses and log lines are described in [cli.md](cli.md),
the fixed address and grace in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

### Readiness probes

A readiness probe is a `server.Probe`, a `func(context.Context) error` that
returns an error when one part of the hub is not ready. `GET /readyz` calls
every probe with the request's context, including those after one has failed,
and answers `503` with `{"status":"not ready"}` if any failed. With no probe
registered the hub is ready. A probe's error text never goes into the
response.

## parley

`cmd/parley` calls `cli.Run(ctx, os.Args[1:], os.Stdout, os.Stderr)` and passes
its result to `os.Exit`. `Run` builds a fresh cobra command tree on each call:
the root command `parley` with the persistent flag `--endpoint-url`, and the
`version` subcommand. It executes the tree with the arguments, and returns `0`,
or `2` after one `error: <message>` line on stderr when cobra cannot parse the
arguments. Cobra's own error and usage output is silenced.

`parley version` reads its build from `internal/buildinfo` and asks the hub
for its build with a plain `net/http` client over HTTP (`GET /version`, 5 s
timeout). `internal/cli` imports `internal/buildinfo` and nothing from
`internal/server`, so the client carries no server code. The commands, output
and exit statuses are described in [cli.md](cli.md).

## Build information

`internal/buildinfo` has three package-level string variables, `Version`,
`Commit` and `BuildTime`, that are set when the binary is linked, with one `-X` linker flag each:

```sh
go build -ldflags "\
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.Version=1.4.0 \
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.Commit=3f2a1bc \
  -X github.com/agent-fox-dev/parley/internal/buildinfo.BuildTime=2026-01-02T03:04:05Z" \
  ./cmd/parleyd
```

The same flags build `./cmd/parley`. `test/e2e` builds both programs this way
and checks that `parley version` reports the values.

`buildinfo.Get()` returns them as a `buildinfo.Info`, with the Go toolchain's
version (`runtime.Version()`) as `GoVersion`. A value that was not set is
reported as `dev` (version) or `unknown` (commit and build time); a value that
was set is reported unchanged. `GET /version` calls `Get()` on every request.

The package lives under `internal/` and outside `internal/server` so that the
client can report its own build without importing server code.
